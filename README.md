## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Height in % - bad idea
- Add components one by one (or group by group)
- Modern web design - it's all about responsibility and adoptiveness, Grids/Flexboxes are essentials though
- Mobile first
- In some strange way sometimes font-size affects on total size of an element, even if it's no text within it, at least when rendering with Firefox
- Save untracked files before repo relocation...

### Continued development

- HTML/CSS basics
- Responsive Web Design

### Useful resources

- [The Principles of Adaptive Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/the-principles-of-adaptive-design/) - great article about responsive web design, gives you a wider point of view at the topic
